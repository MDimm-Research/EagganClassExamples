http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12514197/convert-a-git-folder-to-a-submodule-retrospectively

open issues:
Can I fetch at top level?
or do I have to cd into that specific submodule dir?

then,
git add --all
git commit -m "added subm"
git push -u origin master


all changes can be found by setting the branch to master. So that though problematic is not an incredibly huge issue at moment.
